what is Computer Science?

Computer Science is the study of computers and computational systems, covering areas like algorithms, software development, artificial intelligence, and data structures. It involves both theoretical and practical aspects of computing.

what is Program?

A program is a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform specific tasks or functions. It is typically written in a programming language and can take various forms, such as software applications, scripts, or algorithms. If you meant something else, please provide more context or clarify, and I'll be happy to help.

what is Compiler and Intreper

Compiler: Translates entire source code into machine code or an intermediate code before execution. Produces an executable file, allowing for faster program execution.

Interpreter: Executes source code directly, translating and running it line-by-line. Offers flexibility and ease of debugging but may be slower as it interprets code during runtime.

what is Code?

Code generally refers to a set of instructions written in a programming language that a computer can understand and execute. It is a series of statements and instructions that tell a computer how to perform a specific task or set of tasks. Code can take various forms, including scripts, programs, and applications.

what is Source Code?

Source code is the human-readable version of a computer program, written in a programming language. It contains instructions that computers can understand and execute, forming the basis for software development.

what is difference between Code and Source code?

"Code" is a general term that can refer to any set of instructions for a computer, while "source code" specifically denotes the human-readable version of code written in a programming language.

what is Library?

A library is a collection of pre-written code that addresses common problems in programming. It provides reusable functions and routines, saving developers time and effort in solving well-known challenges.

what is Framework?

A framework is a pre-established structure that provides a foundation for developing software applications. It includes predefined functions and tools, streamlining the development process by offering a standardized environment.

what is difference Library and Framework?

A library is a collection of pre-written code that provides functions and routines for common tasks. A framework, on the other hand, is a pre-established structure that dictates the overall architecture and flow of an application, often incorporating libraries and providing a more comprehensive development environment. In essence, a framework is a higher-level concept that may utilize libraries as part of its structure.

what is Terminal?

A terminal is a text-based interface in computing, allowing users to interact with a computer through commands. It provides a powerful way to execute tasks, manage files, and run programs.
